# Examples

This section provides real-life examples that go beyond the synthetic snippets from the rest of the documentation. 
While those are meant to demonstrate individual functions in isolation, the following examples illustrate how multiple 
features can work together in practice.  

My idea is, that the collection will grow over time as I and others from the community contribute further examples. 
Since these are _real_ use cases, the code and comments may not always be fully in English - some may include parts in 
the authorâ€™s native language (in my case, German). Nevertheless, they should still be easy to understand and valuable 
to share.
